Samsung Final project "FitTrack"

This app is designed to help users achieve their fitness goals by creating personalized workout programs. Users input their height, weight, and current
fitness level (e.g., number of pushups they can do), and the app generates a workout plan for a specified number of days. It sends daily reminders to keep
users on track and allows them to set specific goals, such as increasing the number of pushups from 10 to 20. The app then adjusts the program to gradually
improve their performance, ensuring steady progress without overwhelming them. Users can track their improvements and see how theyâ€™re advancing toward their
goals. At the end of the process, the app uses AI to analyze their progress and offer smart suggestions for further improvement, optimizing their workout
routine and helping them achieve even greater results.
